# 1st Glen Iris Scouts
## Christmas Trees

Get ready for Christmas this December with a Christmas Tree from 1st Glen Iris Scout Group. Our trees are freshly cut Saturday and Sunday mornings from local farms, and brought to Glen Iris for your convenience. Come on down and get one of our premium trees (or two!) to add a bit of Scouty magic to your home this Christmas!

Come find us at 1st Glen Iris Scout Hall, Ferndale Park, 101 Glen Iris Road, Glen Iris.
